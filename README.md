## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, React-bootstrap, HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript 

I built this simple client side React app to further my knowledge of the React framework, I plan on adding a real backend at some point as opposed to the static to do tasks. I found the design of this app and thought it would be cool to build. I'm really enjoying using React on the client side and plan on making better and larger projects with it. Stay tuned!
